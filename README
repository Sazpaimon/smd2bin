Small utility to convert Super MagicDrive (SMD) to linear (BIN) Sega Genesis/MegaDrive ROMs.  Should compile and 
run on all platforms with a C compiler and the standard C libraries including Windows but only tested on Linux.

USAGE:
smd2bin <filename>

EXAMPLE:
smd2bin roms/genesis/sonic2.smd

Outputs sonic2.smd.bin in to roms/genesis/ properly reformatted.
